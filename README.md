<h3>Simple Web Chat App</h3>
<br>
<p>This is a basic chat app written in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the versatile libaries/modules from jQuery and Node.js, as well as the slopiness-friendly web server connection Express can provide, and the generous & convenient database of mongoDB, an amatuer programmer as I would be able to pull everything together and create such an web app.</p>
<br>
<p>So basically when you enter this app, you can set your own user name by typing '/setName <space> username' in the message box. Then you are able to send your messages to the page. I use mongoDB to store user's messages and it holds up to 10 messages. So every time you enter this app, you will see the last ten messages sent before. (Personally, I run this app locally to store my top 10 tasks of the day/week/month.) I also add some cute little text-emoji after every message on the page, just to keep you upbeat.</p>
