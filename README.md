<h3>Simple Web Chat App</h3>
<br>
<p>This is a basic chat app written in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the versatile libaries/modules from jQuery and Node.js, as well as the slopiness-friendly web server connection Express can provide, and the generous & convenient database of mongoDB, an amatuer programmer as I would be able to pull everything together and create such an web app.</p>
<br>
<h5>To users of this app:</h5>
<p>It is a regret that you will have to run some code in your Terminal to chat on this app. Yes, you will have to write command line, you will have to install Node.js and you will have to let Node read my server.js file. But this is all I can do right now.</p>
<br>
<p>But I promise I will become a better programmer.</p>
<br>
<p>So basically when you enter this app, you can set your own user name by typing '/setName <space> username' in the message box. Then you are able to send your messages to the page. I use mongoDB to store user's messages and it holds up to 10 messages. So every time you enter this app, you will see the last ten messages sent before. (Personally, I run this app locally to store my top 10 tasks of the day/week/month.) I also add some cute little text-emoji after every message on the page, just to keep you upbeat.</p>
<br>
<h5>Some final words:</h5>
<p>I enjoyed the process of programming this little app. But I also feel the absence of firmness when programming this small project. I mean there are just so many libaries and modules I could pull from that I did not have to write too many lines of code. I am not sure if future programes would be too dependent on libraries and modules so that they become to fragile. Anyway, I've got a long way to go. This is my first step.</p>

<p>Happy Coding! ヽ(✿ﾟ▽ﾟ)ノ</p>
